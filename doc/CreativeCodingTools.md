Notes
-----

* Surprised that Notch VFX doesn't appear to have direct ShaderToy import,
  since some of the developers (e.g. Edd Biddulph) are active on ShaderToy.

* The Isadora website says that support for multipass ShaderToy shaders is
  coming soon.

* KodeLife is only available as a preview at time of writing. It's not cclear
  whether the developer(s?) intend to commercialise it when it comes out of the
  preview stage.

* KodeLife runs on phones and tablets as well as Windows, Mac and Linux.

* Yes, there's another program called ShaderTool which is already available on
  Steam. Bummer. :-( Time for a rename...
